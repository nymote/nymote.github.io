    Software to control your digital life
</h3>

<p>
    We&#8217;re creating software infrastructure to put users back in 
    control of their digital lives.
</p>

<p>
    The internet has become such a huge part of our daily lives to the 
    extent that it&#8217;s difficult to imagine a world without information 
    and connectivity (literally) at your fingertips. Collaboration is 
    easier, communication simpler and generally work is more productive. 
    However, we&#8217;ve also made sacrifices in order to achieve these 
    gains, in many cases without fully comprehending the risks.
</p>

<p>
    By adopting large centralised services we&#8217;ve answered the call of 
    the siren servers and made an implicit trade. That we will share our 
    habits and data with them in exchange for something useful. In doing so 
    we&#8217;ve empowered internet behemoths while simultaneously reducing 
    our ability to influence them. We risk becoming slaves to the current 
    system unless we can create alternatives that compete. It&#8217;s time 
    to work on those alternatives.

            <h3>
    Tools to build a distributed future
</h3>
    
<p>
    Our approach is to create secure, robust and <em>open-source</em> 
    infrastructure that others can build on. Security and privacy need to be 
    incorporated from the ground up so that promises of &#8220;your data is 
    safe with us&#8221; can be kept by the technology itself. In some cases, 
    this means taking existing tools and technologies and making them much 
    easier to use and deploy. In other cases, it may mean rebuilding tools 
    and creating new products to replace those that are no longer fit for 
    purpose.
</p>
<p>
    We are starting with mechanisms to provide <strong>identity</strong> and 
    <strong>connectivity</strong> for your personal cloud of devices as well 
    as the mechanisms to keep data in sync across them. You can find more 
    detail about those in our <a href='../software/'>software</a> section 
    and get involved in the actual code and discussions by joining the 
    <a href='mailto:amir@nymote.com?&subject=Add%20me%20to%20the%20Nymote%20devel%20list'>Nymote developer mailing list</a>.

<p>
    The underlying building blocks are a crucial piece of the puzzle. We 
    need robust and open-source tools that allow us to create distributed 
    systems that anyone can build on. These tools are the bedrock on which 
    we will create the next generation of products. They deal with the 
    issues of

      Most applications that run in the cloud aren&#8217;t optimised to do so. 
      They inherently carry assumptions about the underlying operating 
      system with them, including vulnerabilities and bloat. 
      <strong>Mirage</strong> represents an approach where only the 
      necessary components are included, allowing for highly efficient and 
      extremely lean &#8216;appliances&#8217;. These can be deployed in 
      environments ranging from Amazon&#8217;s EC2 to the Raspberry Pi.<br />

      Having multiple devices has made the engineering effort around data 
      persistence and sync more complex. We have to concern ourselves about 
      how data obtained for one device is made available and useful to 
      others, without losing history. <strong>Irmin</strong> is a new 
      kind of library database, based on the principles of Git (the version 
      control system), meaning that all history can be kept and moved 
      between devices with ease.<br />

    <p>
      The cloud is a (mostly) always available service that can be seen by 
      all devices. Without this, it is difficult for individual devices to 
      find each other. <strong>Signpost</strong> is building &#8220;personal 
      cloud&#8221; infrastructure to let your devices all see each and reach 
      each other without requiring any complex configuration. Once all your 
      devices can find each other, regardless of location, you effectively 
      have your own little internet.<br />

<p>
    With the new infrastructure, we are able to build robust applications 
    that will push towards a more decentralised web and empower new kinds 
    of innovation and exploration. Building on the right foundations, means 
    the core aspects of connectivity and syncing between devices will 
    already be accounted for so the focus can shift to functionality and 
    extensibility.

    <h3>Mail</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most fundamental and ubiquitous tools we have is email.  In 
      order to completely own your digital presence, we must first be able 
      to easily manage and control our own email communications. At the 
      moment, it's simply too difficult for an individual to run their own 
      email server but there's no reason it can't be simplified. With email 
      servers that work for small groups, like families or friends, we can 
      begin to see routes to new email innovation, where developers can 
      write software that interacts directly with the server to enhance 
      email in ways we cannot right now.

      Our address books have the potential to be the ultimate social network.The data contained within is so valuable that services clamour for 
      access to it, sometimes even 
      <a href="blog/2012/friend-recommendations-and-address-book-privacy/">taking it without your knowledge</a>. 
      It's unfortunate that the that only innovation the humble address book 
      has seen is via third parties who want to gain control of it and put 
      ads in front of you.  An alternative would be to re-imagine your 
      personal address book and make it the core of your online social 
      interactions.  This way, we can incorporate your private data to 
      enhance other services without losing ownership.

    <p>
      Our diaries are the often overlooked part of the trio yet many of us 
      would be lost without proper device synchronisation.  This only 
      becomes more complex the more devices we have and the more we interact 
      with others.  Party invites coming in via social networks and meetings 
      being organised via work all need to find their way to one place, 
      while occasionally letting your partner know when you're likely to be 
      free.  Many services have attempted to solve specific pieces of these 
      problems but it's the integration with your Mail, Contacts and other 
      services which will unleash more productivity.

<p>
    Building lightweight, secure and highly scalable systems, specifically 
    geared to live on the cloud is not a trivial undertaking. Even though 
    it’s possible to string together something quick with existing tools, 
    they're ultimately limited since they lack the necessary security 
    considerations. To build resilient and distributed systems of this kind 
    requires deep expertise in the areas of networking, distributed software 
    and the cloud.
