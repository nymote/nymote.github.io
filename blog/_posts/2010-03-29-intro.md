We've been working away at building a new type of database to help
individuals keep reigns on their ever-increasing personal digital
information.  The first prototypes run freely on <a
href="http://code.google.com/appengine">Google App Engine</a> to
gather your data behind-the-scenes, and we are working on more
advanced versions that run on embedded devices and the cloud.

If you're interested in keeping track of your personal data, you can
start off with the <a href="/install.html">installation</a>
instructions to clone your own version.  After that, read up on the <a
href="/design.html">design</a> of the system (which is still changing
as we research new ideas around it).  When you find something you want
to fix, or add a new plugin data source, just clone the <a
href="http://github.com/avsm/perscon">code</a> and send us back fixes!
