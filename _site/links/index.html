For example, Serf can maintain the list of web servers for a load balancer and notify that load balancer whenever a node comes online or goes offline. (2) Failure detection and recovery - Serf automatically detects failed nodes within seconds, notifies the rest of the cluster, and executes handler scripts allowing you to handle these events. Serf will attempt to recover failed nodes by reconnecting to them periodically. (3) Custom event propagation - Serf can broadcast custom events to the cluster. These can be used to trigger deploys, propagate configuration, etc."</p>

        <p>"By 2017, more than half of companies will require their employees to supply their own devices on the job. The finding comes in a new report from Gartner containing the results of a survey of CIOs around the world. So it&#8217;s not for nothing that Gartner calls these BYOD strategies 'the most radical change to the economics and culture of client computing' in a decade."</p>

        <p>Departments outside IT are increasingly solving their own problems using 3rd party providers. This is great for productivity but IT has no idea what's going on. Apparently 50% of IT spend at top performing companies is already outside the purview of Central IT --- "Gartner predicts that in less than three years, 35% of enterprise IT expenditures will happen outside of the corporate IT budget. Employees will regularly subscribe to collaboration, analytic and other cloud services they want, all with the press of a button. Others will simply build their own applications using readily available cloud-based tools and development platforms."</p>

The technology isn't capable of blending the two sides seamlessly yet, but it's moving in that direction."</p>
