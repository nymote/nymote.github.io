Most applications that run in the cloud aren't optimised to do so.  They 
inherently carry assumptions about the underlying operating system with 
them, including vulnerabilities and bloat.  **Mirage** represents an 
approach where only the necessary components are included, allowing for 
highly efficient and extremely lean 'appliances'.  These can be deployed in 
environments ranging from Amazon's EC2 to the Raspberry Pi.  

Compartmentalisation of large servers into smaller 'virtual machines' has 
enabled many new businesses to get started and achieve scale.  This has been 
great for new services but many of those virtual machines are single-purpose 
and yet they contain largely complete operating systems which themselves run 
applications like web-servers.  This means a large part of the footprint is 
unused and unnecessary, which is both costly and a security risk.

**Mirage** represents a new approach to deploying and managing services that 
are designed to be small, lean and secure.  By turning software into these 
small 'appliances', Mirage can take full advantage of the cloud while 
dramatically reducing costs and simultaneously increasing security and 
scalability.
